					StockKeeper was founded in 2020 by a group of entrepreneurs
					who experienced first-hand the challenges of managing
					inventory across multiple warehouses. Frustrated with
					clunky, expensive software, they knew there had to be a
					better way.
					<br />
					<br />
					We started with a simple mission: build the inventory tool
					we always wished existed — fast, beautiful, and intuitive.
					Today, over 5,000 businesses across 30+ countries trust
					StockKeeper to run their operations smoothly.
